# Configuration

---

Cijul doesn't need any configuration to get started.

It is, however, fairly inevitable that you'll want to provide your own custom config for certain rules.

You can do this by passing a custom config object into `init`.

```js
import { init } from '@nearform/cijul'

const cijulConfig = {
  color: {
    red: '#bd0000'
  }
}

init(cijulConfig)
```

You only need to call `init` once and it needs to be called before you import any modules which use Cijul.

The best way to achieve this is to create a config file and import it into your application entry point.

For example, in [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) you can initiate Cijul in `./src/index.js`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
import './cijul-config'
import App from './App'
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: http://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister()
```

With `./cijul-config.js` containing the example shown above.
