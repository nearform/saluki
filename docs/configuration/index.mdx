# Configuration

---

Cijul doesn't need any configuration to get started.

It is, however, fairly inevitable that you'll want to provide your own custom config for certain rules.

You can do this by passing a custom config object into the default function exported from Cijul.

```js
import init from '@nearform/cijul'

const cijulConfig = {
  color: {
    red: '#bd0000'
  }
}

init(cijulConfig)
```

You only need to call `init` once so it's best to do so as early in your application startup as possible.

For example, in [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) you can initiate Cijul in `./src/index.js`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker'
import init from '@nearform/cijul'

const cijulConfig = {
  color: {
    red: '#bd0000'
  }
}

init(cijulConfig)

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: http://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister()
```

As your custom config grows you might want to extract it out into its own module.

```js
export default {
  color: {
    red: '#bd0000'
  }
}
```

```js
import init from '@nearform/cijul'
import cijulConfig from './cijul-config'

init(cijulConfig)
```

Or even abstract the whole initialisation out.

```js
import init from '@nearform/cijul'

const cijulConfig = {
  color: {
    red: '#bd0000'
  }
}

init(cijulConfig)
```

```js
import './cijul-config'
```
